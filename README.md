# 📝 Random Quote Generator

A simple web-based application that displays random quotes along with the quote author. Users can add their own quotes, which are stored in the browser using `localStorage`.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for page structure
- **CSS** – for styling
- **JavaScript** – for logic and interactivity
- **localStorage** – to persist quotes across sessions

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Displays a random quote and its author.
- ✅ Add new quotes using an input form.
- ✅ Quotes are saved in `localStorage`.
- ✅ Dynamic DOM manipulation.
- ✅ Uses JavaScript functions for modularity.

## 💡 How It Works

1. The app loads with a predefined or saved list of quotes.
2. A random quote is displayed on load or when the "Generate Quote" button is clicked.
3. Users can add new quotes by providing:
   - The quote text
   - The author's name
4. Quotes are saved in `localStorage` so they persist across page reloads.
